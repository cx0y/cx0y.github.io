The philoshopy of owning less, ***Minimalism*** is a trend this days, 
in the name of ***minimalism***, people are rejecting all things even essentials, 
it's not a philoshopy, I call it a madness, owning less is always not good, mine approach is, 
own things has personal value to you, understanding the meaning of ownning, 
in that sense I want to own more, have really value to me! and the idea here is **Counterintutive**
than people interpret minimalism, and this is what I call my own ***Minimalism***, 
owning less, what I called ***boredom*** to me. You should intricate your intellectual masterpiece in your owning!, It's what that talse about you! **Owning A Timeless!**
