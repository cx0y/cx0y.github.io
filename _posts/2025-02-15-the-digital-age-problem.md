# The Digital Age Problem

In this very digital age, we are loaded with information, and too much information leading to our doom, we are not very intentional with our own works, like there is a something always here to take our attention span, and that is our laptop, phone or other digital devices! we barely have time to read physical books, and there is also hype of digital books and kindle like devices… 

What is the point of doing this, what is the point of writing this? well we are getting information so quick, and nothing wrong with that?! but out very own thinking is stripped out from the equation, we are making us busy with digital devices, and wasting most valuable time we have! 

so yeah, someone might argue, digital devices has various advantages, yeah sure no deny on that, but we are getting too much distracted from this kind of devices, and the weight of harm is greater than, the weight of gain, yeah in this digital age we can’t just throw away our digital belongings, that also have a huge disadvantage against society, but we should forgot we are throwing away another very most important tool over millennia, that is our lone notebook

so we should very intentional with this doom age, digital devices nothing but mere tools, that can’t have life long impact, as your notebook could have! instead of bonding with this kind of devices, we should, very careful with our intention of using digital devices!
